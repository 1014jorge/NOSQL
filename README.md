## Description

 An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I used a native JavaScript Date getter to format timestamps.
The purpose of this application is to help any social meadia website handle large amounts of unstructured data.
